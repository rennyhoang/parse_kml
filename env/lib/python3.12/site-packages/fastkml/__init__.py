"""
Fastkml is a library to read, write and manipulate kml files. It aims to keep
it simple and fast (using lxml if available). Fast refers to the time you spend
to write and read KML files as well as the time you spend to get aquainted to
the library or to create KML objects. It provides a subset of KML and is aimed
at documents that can be read from multiple clients such as openlayers and
google maps rather than to give you all functionality that KML on google earth
provides.
